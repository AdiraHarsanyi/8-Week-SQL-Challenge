## Problem Statement:
"Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Question 1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```SQL
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS sum_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales

INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sum_sales DESC; 
```
Result:
| customer_id | sum_sales |
| ----------- | --------- |
| A           | 76        |
| B           | 74        |
| C           | 36        |

Question 2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

```SQL
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT sales.order_date) AS num_days, sales.customer_id
FROM dannys_diner.sales

GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY num_days DESC;
```


Result:
| num_days | customer_id |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 6        | B           |
| 4        | A           |
| 2        | C           |
